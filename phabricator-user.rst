**********
User Guide
**********

As Mozilla's Phabricator instance has only small modifications from
stock Phabricator, much of `Phabricator's user documentation
<https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/book/phabricator/>`_ is fully
applicable.  Several sections are of particular interest.

**Differential** is Phabricator's code-review tool.  Useful articles
include the `Differential User Guide
<https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/book/phabricator/article/differential/>`_,
the `FAQ
<https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/book/phabricator/article/differential_faq/>`_,
and the `Inline Comments guide
<https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/book/phabricator/article/differential_inlines/>`_.
As usual, there are other articles available for specific subjects.

Another useful application is **Herald**, which can perform actions,
such as sending notifications, based on object changes (such as a
Differential revision being created or updated).  There is a short
`user guide
<https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/book/phabricator/article/herald/>`_
available.

**MozPhab** is a custom command-line tool, `moz-phab
<https://github.com/mozilla-conduit/review>`_, which communicates to Phabricator's
API, providing several conveniences, including support for submitting series of
commits.

.. _creating-account:

*******************
Creating an Account
*******************

The first step toward submitting a patch via Phabricator is to create
an account.  Visit our Phabricator instance at
https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/ and click the "Log In" button
at the top of any page.

.. image:: images/login-button.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Screenshot of Phabricator login button

You'll be taken to another page with a single button, which will in
turn take you to `bugzilla.mozilla.org
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org>`_ (BMO) to log in or register a new
account.

.. image:: images/bmo-login.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Screenshot of BMO login button

After you've done so, you'll be redirected back to Phabricator, where
you will be prompted to create a new Phabricator account.  On this
form, the "Real Name" field is taken from your BMO account's real
name.  If your BMO real name also contains the ``:<matrixnick>``
convention, that is, a username starting with a colon, it will be
extracted and placed into the Phabricator account's username field.
Common surrounding punctuation, e.g. parentheses (``()``) and brackets
(``[]``) will be stripped out and discarded.  If you've used some
other way to separate or emphasize your username, you'll have to
remove the extraneous characters from the Real Name field manually
before clicking "Register Account".  The following screenshot shows
the account-creation form, with default values, for a BMO user with
the real name "Phabricator Test [:phabtest]".

.. image:: images/create-account.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Screenshot of account-creation form

Note that the username field is mandatory, so if you didn't have one
automatically filled in, you'll have to pick one.

.. important:: The username field is unique.  You should pick a
   clearly identifiable username, particularly if you will be doing
   code reviews, such as your nick on chat.mozilla.org.  If your nick
   is not available but you think it should be because, for example,
   you are at least somewhat known in the Mozilla community, please
   `file a bug
   <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Conduit&component=Administration>`_
   or let us know in `#conduit <https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#conduit:mozilla.org>`_ on chat.mozilla.org.

You now have a Phabricator account set up and can both submit and
review patches (along with using the other Phabricator applications).

.. _setting-up-mozphab:

******************
Setting up MozPhab
******************

The preferred and officially supported ways to submit patches are via
our custom command-line tool, `moz-phab
<https://github.com/mozilla-conduit/review>`_. ``moz-phab`` currently requires Arcanist
and will install it automatically.

Installing the tool depends on your operating system:

* :doc:`Windows 10 MozPhab Installation Guide </mozphab-windows>`
* :doc:`Linux MozPhab Installation Guide </mozphab-linux>`
* :doc:`macOS MozPhab Installation Guide </mozphab-macos>`

The next step is to authenticate MozPhab with our Phabricator
installation.  From within your project's repository, run the
following command::

    $ moz-phab install-certificate

This will prompt you to visit a page on our Phabricator instance, which
will generate an API key for you to paste into your terminal.  The
key is stored in the file ``.arcrc`` in your home directory.

******************
Submitting Patches
******************

.. _using-moz-phab:

Using moz-phab
==============

moz-phab is a custom command-line tool that improves on Arcanist's
limited support for commit series, as well as providing other
conveniences, including the parsing of bug IDs and reviewers from
commit messages.  We recommend using it if you regularly construct
stacks of dependent changesets, or even if you regularly review them.

Installation and usage instructions are in the repository's `README.md
<https://github.com/mozilla-conduit/review/blob/master/README.md>`_.
Note that moz-phab is in active development, with new features and
improvements landing regularly.  See the current `bug list
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?product=Conduit&component=Review%20Wrapper&resolution=--->`_
for details.

.. _reviewing-patches:

*****************
Reviewing Patches
*****************

Performing a review involves two steps, both of which are technically
optional but will usually be used together:

1. Leaving comments on the diff and/or on the revision generally.
2. Choosing an action to indicate the next step for the author.

Leaving comments is fairly straightforward.  For inline diff comments,
click on the line number where you want to leave a comment, and enter
some text.  The text editor is quite rich; you can use many styling
and formatting tools.  Below the diff is another text-entry box, which
can be used for general comments ("Looks good to me", "Here are some
suggestions for your overall design", etc.).

At this point you can click the "Submit" button at the bottom;
however, this will leave the review open.  You might want to do this
if you have some preliminary comments and plan to give a more detailed
review later.  Usually you will want to use the "Add Action..."
dropdown to signal a clear intent to the revision author and to
communicate what they should do next.  These actions include:

* **Accept Revision**: The diff is good as it is and can be landed, or
  at most requires small changes that do not need re-review.
* **Request Changes**: The diff needs some changes before it can be
  landed.  Specific change requests should be left as comments, as
  described above.
* **Resign as Reviewer**: This indicates that you are not able to or
  do not wish to review this change.  You will be removed from the
  reviewers list and hence will not get notifications of updates to
  the revision.  You should explain in a comment why you are resigning
  (e.g. going on vacation soon, not your area of expertise, etc.) and
  ideally a substitute reviewer or other action for the author to
  take, if there are no longer sufficient reviewers on the revision.

**********************
Other Revision Actions
**********************

In addition to the review-related actions mentioned in the
:ref:`reviewing-patches` section, there are other common tasks that are
accomplished through the actions dropdown.  The following are
available to revision authors:

* **Request Review**: Asks the reviewer(s) to take another look at the
  revision.  If it is not already, the revision status will be changed
  to "Needs Review".  If a reviewer has previously accepted the
  revision, their review status will be changed to "Accepted Prior
  Diff" (the icon for this status is similar to the "Accepted"
  checkmark, but it is grey instead of green).
* **Plan Changes**: Removes revisions from reviewers' queues, meaning
  that they will no longer be visible under "Ready to Review" on their
  "Active Revisions" dashboards, until a new diff is uploaded.  The
  revision will appear under "Ready to Update" on the author's "Active
  Revisions" dashboard.
* **Abandon Revision**: Indicates that a revision is no longer
  relevant and should be disregarded.
* **Reopen Revision**: Reopens a revision that has been closed (either
  manually or automatically) after a revision landed.
* **Reclaim Revision**: Reopens a revision that has been abandoned.

There is another action available specifically to nonauthors:

* **Commandeer Revision**: Allows you to take over a revision by
  becoming its author.  Note that the original author will no longer
  be able to post updated diffs to the revision. Note: Lando doesn't care
  who owns the revision on Phabricator, but, it does care about the commit
  author. When updating someone else's commit, you can use
  ``hg commit --amend --user "Other Person <example@mozilla.com>"`` or
  ``git commit --amend --author="Other Person <example@mozilla.com>"`` to set
  the commit author information to the right person.

After selecting an action, you must always hit the "Submit" button
below.  You may optionally add a comment to indicate your reasoning
behind the action or other relevant notes.

***************
Landing Patches
***************

For Mercurial repositories, in particular `mozilla-central
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central>`_, we highly recommend using
:doc:`Lando </lando-user>`.  See :ref:`getting-in-touch` to have
repositories added to Phabricator and Lando.

If you cannot use Lando, we highly recommend manually landing
to mozilla-inbound without the use of ``arc patch`` nor ``arc land``,
both of which add metadata to the commit message which may not be
desirable, such as the list of revision subscribers.

If you do not have the commit applied locally and you are landing someone else's
patch, you can run ``moz-phab patch D<revision id> --nobranch`` to apply the
commit(s) locally (``--nobranch`` ensures the commits are applied to the current
branch/head). You can then push the commits as usual.

You could also run ``moz-phab patch --apply-to here --nocommit --skip-dependencies
D<revision id>`` instead. This will apply the diff locally but not commit it,
nor will it apply any parents.  You can then commit it manually, using the
revision title as the first line of the commit message and the Summary field
as the body.

****************
Our Installation
****************

Mozilla's Phabricator instance is a stock installation, with a small patch
applied, and some custom extensions.  The patch and extensions are
intentionally small in scope and are limited to supporting integration
points with `bugzilla.mozilla.org <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org>`_
("BMO").

See :ref:`conduit-repos` for the location of our source code.

************
Applications
************

Phabricator is actually a suite of many applications, from a
code-review tool to wikis to a blogging platform.  At Mozilla, we
already have existing applications that solve many of these problems.
To prevent the re-emergence of the all-too-common problem of having to
choose between several tools that are all functionally similar, we
have disabled the use of some of these applications.

The default left-side menu in Phabricator lists the most important
applications for Mozilla's use case.  In addition to Differential and
Herald, described above, we support or are trialing several other
applications and utilities:

* **Dashboards** allow users to set up custom pages to display useful
  information, for example assigned reviews.  It seems somewhat
  limited, though, so we'll evaluate how useful it really is.

* **Pholio** is an application for reviewing mock-ups and designs.
  Mozilla doesn't have a central application for this, so we'd like
  your input on whether Pholio is useful.

* **Badges**, **macros**, and **tokens**: These are mostly bits of
  whimsy that might enhance user experience by providing some levity.
  If they're fun, or at least harmless, we'll leave them; if they
  become annoying or distracting, we may remove them.

Note that Phabricator also has a post-commit review system called
**Audit**.  This application is mandatory, that is, it cannot be
disabled in a Phabricator installation.  However, at the moment
Mozilla has no defined engineering processes for post-commit review of
Firefox and related code, so we do not recommend its use, at least
until such time as a process is deemed necessary and implemented.
Audit may, of course, be useful to projects hosted on the Mozilla
Phabricator instance outside of Firefox.

.. _bmo-integration:

***************
BMO Integration
***************

Since issue tracking and code review are tightly related, and since
BMO is currently the authority for identity and authorization around
both issue tracking and code review, including security and other
confidential bugs and fixes, our Phabricator instance is integrated
with BMO.  This integration is intentionally lightweight in order to
limit customization of Phabricator, which has both maintenance and
opportunity costs.  It consists of identity, authorization, links
between bugs and revisions, and basic review-status mirroring.

Identity
========

As described in the :ref:`creating-account` section, the main way to
log into Phabricator is via BMO's auth delegation.  A user logging
into Phabricator is taken to BMO to log in as usual and will be
redirected back to Phabricator if the login succeeds.  If this is the
first time the user has logged into Phabricator, they will be prompted
to create an account.  New users will also be prompted to enter a
separate username, unlike BMO.

Authorization
=============

If a bug has one or more security groups applied to it, that is, it
has restricted visibility, any Differential revisions associated with
it are similarly restricted in visibility.  This will initially only
apply to Firefox security groups, that is, groups with names matching
``*core-security*``.  Any revision associated with a bug restricted
via other groups, e.g. infra, is visible only to the author and
admins.  We can add proper support for such groups on request.

Links from Differential to BMO
==============================

A bug number must be entered when a patch is submitted to Phabricator.
This is stored in the revision metadata and provided in the UI as a
link to the associated bug on BMO.

Links from BMO to Differential
==============================

Upon the creation of a new revision in Differential, a stub
attachment, containing only the URL of the revision, is added to the
associated bug.  Based on the attachment type, BMO automatically
redirects to Differential if the attachment link is clicked.

Review flags
============

Review flags are not set on Differential stub attachments.  The
difference in models between the two systems make any such mapping
both difficult and potentially misleading, the requisite information
is not exposed via Phabricator's Conduit API, and Phacility have
informed us that Differential's models may be changing.

We will, however, display some revision metadata in associated
bugs; see `bug 1489706
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1489706>`_.

***************
Uplift Requests
***************

Uplift requests are submitted as regular review request on Phabricator.
See `the Release Management guide <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Requesting_an_Uplift>`_
for more details on how to submit an uplift request.

**************************
Mozilla Phabricator Emails
**************************

.. image:: images/phab-email-new.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Screenshot of an example new Phabricator email

Mozilla has an internal email implementation that
integrates with Phabricator and has the following benefits:

* There's less noise per email, and fewer emails are sent per event.
* Relevant contextual information is now more clearly available.
* Each email is visually structured to be helpful and fast to read.

These emails are used by default. However, if you'd prefer to opt-out
and use the standard Phabricator Emails, you can adjust your settings:

1. Open `Phabricator <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/>`_.
2. Click on your avatar in the top right, and click "Settings".
3. On the left panel, click on "Email Delivery".
4. Change the value of the "Email Notifications" dropdown box and click "Save Changes".

.. image:: images/phab-email-new-setting.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Screenshot of the setting to enable Mozilla Phabricator emails

.. note:: There are features from the original Phabricator emails that aren't (yet) replicated
   to the new implementation, including:

   * `Herald rules to notify via email aren't used <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1681602>`_.
   * `X- headers are missing, most notably X-Phabricator-Stamps <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667308>`_.

Mozilla Conduit
###############

Conduit is the set of systems involved in submitting code to
`mozilla-central
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/mozilla-central>`_,
the Mercurial repository that contains all the code required to build
Firefox.  These systems handle everything from posting a patch for
review up to landing it in mozilla-central.  The applications are a
mix of third-party tools, extensions to these tools, and custom
applications.  Code for these systems is in various places; please see the
documentation for individual applications.
